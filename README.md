# Image Position Matching
This repository provides a solution for detecting the position of a smaller image within a larger image using computer vision techniques. The implementation uses Python and OpenCV to perform template matching and feature-based matching to returns the coordinates of the top-left corner of the smaller image in the larger image.
### Objective
Given two images:

A [larger image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UqRqni9exxxWUj9sxJTfkyj2GHREkWMf/view) (big image).
A [smaller image] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SOlJshvAOCwhM92YTPXHXurJS1h_Uf6l/view) (template to find within the larger image).
The goal is to detect the position of the smaller image within the larger one and return its top-left corner coordinates.
